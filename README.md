TrayWeek
========

Displays the current week number in the windows tray, according ISO 8601 (Swedish standard).
ISO 8601 states that the first week of the year is the week that contains the first Thursday of the year.

Implemented as a windowless WPF application for .NET 8 (runtime required).  
NuGet dependencies: [Hardcodet.NotifyIcon.Wpf](https://github.com/hardcodet/wpf-notifyicon)

The application will try to detect the Windows version, and Windows theme (dark or light), for best results.

Users must themselves choose to permanently show the tray icon in the system settings!
